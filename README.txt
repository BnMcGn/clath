This is the stub README.txt for the "clath" project.

Registering OAuth apps:

-You need to register your website as an app with each login provider. You
will be given an ID and SECRET by the login provider. When these are installed
in the correct place in ubiquitous, authentication will become available from
that provider.

Hints:

Github:
-Log in to your account
-Settings -> OAuth applications (look under Developer settings) ->
 Register a new application
-If http://yoursite.somewhere/ is your site, then:

http://yoursite.somewhere/clath/callback/github

is your callback url.
